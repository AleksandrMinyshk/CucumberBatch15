 #HOOKS: For defining pre and Post steps in any Cucumber framework
    #     : This is always created inside the StepDefinitions folder
    #     : Hooks will take care of pre and post conditions irrespective
    #     : of what goes in between the test steps


    #BACKGOROUND: This is used to define all the common steps that multiple
    #            scenarios have in the same feature file, till the time flow is not broken
    # 1. Hard Code
    # 2. Config File
    #---------Cucumber itself provides multiple option through which we can feed data from
    #          feature file into Step Definition-------------------------
    # 3. Regular Expressions
    # put the data in double quotes [""]

    #============================PARAMETRIZATION==========================
    #  Executing the same test case with multiple data

    #If you want to use parameterization
    #If you wish to implement data driven testing
      # Scenario Outline is always used along with the keyword 'Examples'



    #  hooks @before -> Background -> Steps -> Hooks @After ======> Flow
